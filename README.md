# eslint-config-paglias

A set of reusable ESLint rules.

Information about installation and usage can be found at http://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/shareable-configs

This config is meant to be used for projects that make heavy use of ES6 syntax through [BabelJS]() and so it requires the following packages to work correctly `babel-eslint eslint-plugin-babel`.

This module is not available on npm so it must be installed directly from the git repository.
A new tag is created for each new release.

### TODO
- [ ] separate BabelJS rules
- [ ] create different configs for NodeJS, React, Vue projects
- [ ] publish to npm
